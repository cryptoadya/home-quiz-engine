# Architecture v0

This document is intentionally small. It defines boundaries, not implementation ceremony.

## One local application

Run one local service on the host computer. Guests connect over the same Wi-Fi network.

Logical pieces:

- `apps/web` — React UI for Admin, Host, Screen, Player
- `apps/server` — Express API + Socket.IO + SQLite access + local media serving
- `themes` — theme manifests/assets/styles
- `data/quizzes` — local per-quiz media/data area at runtime (gitignored)

No microservices.

## State ownership

Server is authoritative for:

- active game session and phase
- fixed player roster after Start Game
- online/disconnected state
- timer deadlines / remaining time
- accepted Submit events
- scores
- pause/resume
- reveal and navigation state
- room code ownership

Clients render server state and send intents.

## HTTP vs realtime

Use HTTP for slow CRUD:

- quiz editor CRUD
- round/question edits
- media upload/delete
- import/export
- history reads

Use Socket.IO for active-session events:

- player join/reconnect/disconnect
- start game/round/question
- media control
- timer/pause/resume
- submit
- answered count
- reveal
- next question/round
- leaderboard/final/winner

## Database

SQLite is enough. Start with a small schema; do not normalize for hypothetical scale.

Expected entities:

- quizzes
- rounds
- questions
- answer_options / matching_pairs
- media
- game_sessions
- session_players
- session_answers (active-session durability only; detailed historical analytics are not a requirement)

## Quiz snapshot

When a real/test game starts, create an immutable in-memory/database snapshot sufficient to prevent editor changes from altering that running session. Do not build version-control semantics around it.

## Media

Each quiz owns its own copied media. No cross-quiz dedup/reference counting in V1.

## Themes

Game components are shared. Theme configuration/assets modify presentation only. Missing theme parts fall back to Default.
